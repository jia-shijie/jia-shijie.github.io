I am an Associate Professor in the Key Laboratory of Cyberspace Security Defense, Institute of Information Engineering (IIE), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). I obtained my Ph.D degree from the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS) in 2017. My research interests lie in the general area of <font color="light blue"> Applied Cryptography, Privacy
Protection, Network and System Security</font>, particularly in Cryptographic Misuse Detection, Data Storage Security (e.g., solid state storage and cloud storage), as well as and Information System Security Evaluation. I have published 40+ papers on security venues, such as ACM CCS (17), IEEE TDSC (21), ACSAC (16,17,22), ESORICS (23) and AsiaCCS (16,19). I won Distinguished Paper Award of ACSAC 2017.
